#  Pokemon Picker

This is a repo where I am using Pokemon API to display Pokemon as per requirements

## Features

 - display 3 pokemon per row and each row consist it's image, name, height , weight  and abilities
 - user can search within page
 - user can sort by name, height and weight
 - user can fetch next 20 pokemon list using pagination.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory,  run:

 1. `npm install` to install dependencies

 2. after completion of first command, run `npm run start`



## TODO
